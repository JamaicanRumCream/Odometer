// This class displays an accurate-to-life analog automobile odometer
// With the animation speed fudged for high number differential changing
// Layout is very size dependant- aspect ratio is not guaranteed. Self-expanding is not happening.
// This is ONLY for analog style odometer, digital counting (ie no animation) not supported.
